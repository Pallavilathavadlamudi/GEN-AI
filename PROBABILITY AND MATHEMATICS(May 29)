# PRODUCT ADOPTION MODEL

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
To analyze and predict the likelihood of customers liking, purchasing, and responding to a new product and its related variants?

#Questions:
    1. Do people like this product?
    2. Do people get (buy) this product?
    3. What is the probability that a customer will return to buy again?
    4. What’s the chance a person will recommend this product to others?
    5. What’s the probability of profit/loss after launching the product?
    6. What happens when we implement a family of this product in the market?
    
    Later if the product is liked by the people:
    1. If we increase the price, what is the probability that purchases will drop?


# BASIC IDEA 

1. PROBABILITY: 

    Is a meaasure of how likely something is to happen 
        1. It is a number bwtween 0 and 1  
            0 is not likely to happen
            1 is likely to happen
            0.5 (between) there is an equal chance of event happening or not happening


    Explaning the above questions:

    Consider a survey taken from the 100 people. 

    1. Do people like this product? (this question estimates how many customers liked the product)

            Probability :  Number of people liked the product / Total number of people visited the product
                = 75/100 = 0.75

    2. Do people get (buy) this product? (this question estimates how many people actually purchased the product)

            Probability : Number of people purchased/ Number of people liked the product
                = 30/75 = 0.4

    3. What is the probability that a customer will return to buy again? (this question estimates whether the customer rebuys the product or not)

            Probability : Number of people wanted to rebuy / number of people once purchased
                = 15/30 = 0.5

    4. What’s the chance a person will recommend this product to others?(this question estimates do really customer suggest to the other people)

             Probability : Number of customers suggested / Number of people purchased
                = 10/30 = 0.33

2. RANDOM EXPERIMENT: 

    It is process that leads to one outcome from possible outcomes. where we dont know in advance which outcome will occur.

    Related to the problem statement:
       
        Each customer interaction with the product can be seen as a Random Experiment (Notice, Like, buy, rebuy, recommend)

        Each Question = A random Experiment 
            The outcome would be 
                1. Noticed / Didnot Noticed 
                2. Liked / Didnot Liked
                3. Buy / Didnot Buy
                4. Recommend / willnot recommend

3. RANDOM VARIABLE:

        Is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment. 
    
    TYPES: 
    1. DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES: 

        Variables that can take countable values such as 1,2,3,...

            Related to the problem statement:
            
                1. Number of people liked product
                2. Number of purchases
                3. Number of Recommendations

    2. CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES:
     
        Variables that can take an infinite number of values in a given range.
    
            Related to the problem statement:

                1. Money Spent
                2. Customer Satisfaction

4. BASIC OUTCOME, SAMPLING SPACE, EVENT: 

    1. BASIC OUTCOME: 

        Is a most specific result of a random experiment(any one of the possible outcome from a random experiment)
    
    2. SAMPLING SPACE(S): 

        The set of all possible outcomes for any random experiment is called Sampling Space.
    
    3. EVENT(E):
    
        The outcome of any experiment is called an event. (E)

    Related to the problem statement:

        1. Do people like this product?
            Basic outcome: {like},{Don't like}
            Sampling Space: S = {like, Don't like}
            Event: E = {Like} -> customer like the product.
        
        2. Do people buy this product?
            Basic outcome: {Buy},{Don't buy}
            Sampling Space: S = {buy, Don't buy}
            Event: E = {Buy} -> Customer buys the product.

        3. Will customer buy again?
            Basic outcome: {rebuy},{Don't rebuy} / return
            Sampling Space: S = {rebuy, Don't rebuy} / return
            Event: E = {rebuy} -> customer rebuys the product.

        4. Will customer recommend?
            Basic outcome: {recommend},{Don't recommend}
            Sampling Space: S = {recommend, Don't recommend}
            Event: E = {Dont recommend} -> Customer doesnot recommend the product.

        5. How much will a customer spend?
            Basic outcome: {10},{20},{30}
            Sampling Space: S = {any real number > 0 }
            Event: E = {30} -> Customer spends 30$ on the product.

        6. What rating will customer give?
            Basic outcome: {1},{2},{3}
            Sampling Space: S = {1,2,3,...,10}
            Event: E = {8} -> Customer gives rating for product as 8. 

# FUNCTIONS 

1. PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION: 
       
        Is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
        
                        pX(x)=P(X=x)

            Related to the problem statement:

            Consider the Survey of 100 people 
                Consider the results as 
                    1. 20 people didn’t buy at all (0 times)
                    2. 50 people bought once
                    3. 20 people bought twice
                    4. 10 people bought three times

                Consider the result as 
                    1. 15 people didnot rate the product
                    2. 20 People gave 1 star rating
                    3. 20 people gave 2 star rating
                    4. 15 people gave 3 star rating
                    5. 25 people gave 4 star rating
                    6. 5 people gave 5 star rating
                    
            Question

            1. How many times did the people buy the product?

                Consider X = Number of times a person bought the product in month
                Possible values(0,1,2,3)

                pX(x)=P(X=x)= Number of people who bought x times/Total number of people surveyed

                p(0) = 20/100 = 0.2 (didnot buy) 
                p(1) = 50/100 = 0.5 (bought once)   
                p(2) = 20/100 = 0.2 (bought twice)
                p(3) = 10/100 = 0.1 (bought thrice)

            2. How did customers rate the product?
                
                pX(x)=P(X=x)= total number of people rate the product / Total number of people surveyed

                p(0) = 15/100 = 0.15
                p(1) = 20/100 = 0.2
                p(2) = 20/100 = 0.2
                p(3) = 15/100 = 0.15
                p(4) = 25/100 = 0.25
                p(5) = 5/100 =  0.05
